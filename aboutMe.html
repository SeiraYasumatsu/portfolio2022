              <!-- <h1>Seira Yasumatsu</h1>-->
               <p>Currently, I'm at IPMD, where I'm at the forefront of revolutionizing how businesses and healthcare providers leverage facial and emotional AI to enhance their services.<br></br>
                 Prior to this, my journey led me to TogetherWell, where I crafted user-centric workshop pages. By optimizing the visibility of paid member offerings and touchpoints, I successfully increased workshop sign-ups and membership rates.<br></br>
                 My passion for design lies in the intersection of technology, human experience, and education, and I'm excited to continue pushing boundaries and creating meaningful solutions that bridge these worlds.</p>

              <h1>From the path of an educator to the way of the designer</h1>
              <p>I realized I wanted to be a designer when I started to work with children. While I was working as a creative director, I started to notice toys,
                pieces of furniture, or systems that were not working well with children, teachers, or caretakers. I began to address each problem by observing children and the environment,
                identifying the exact problem, implementing the solutions while testing, getting feedback, and creating prototypes along the way. I was intrigued by the process of design and
                what design can achieve. This experience led me to pursue a degree in industrial design. <br></br> While I loved working with different materials and building 3D products,
                my strength has been to find the right problem to solve, connect with users, and offer a creative solution to a problem, so I decided to enroll in an apprenticeship at Bloc
                where I built my skill set as a UX/product designer and front-end developer.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="text text3">
             <h1>But I am also a collaborator that yearns to connect with others so that ideas and dreams become reality--together.</h1>
             <p>From years of working with young children, I am an invested listener that would meet them where they were and
               understand their message. I spent 7000+ hours observing and figuring out how I could facilitate their needs. I collaborated
               with 70+ users to understand their pain points and the opportunity to optimize their experience. This led me to design a
               versatile garden tool that won an award of $2000 for the Stanford Design Challenge.
               My continuous curiosity towards products, business, people, and technology keeps evolving me into a better designer that always wants to learn more. </p>
