           <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
           <p>STEMA is a social platform that facilitates girls, educators, and parents to form the STEM community to encourage them to stay in the STEM field. With wearable devices, girls can learn how to code and connect to the STEMA website to share their progress and teach each other. The goal of this project was to create
             a product that is not only appeals to the main users, girls but also provides resources and creates support between essential supporters such as teachers and parents. </p>

            <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
            <h3>Girls tend to lose interest in STEM </h3>
            <p>Elementary school girls aged between 9 to 13 tend to lose interest in STEM education. While the scores of standardized achievement tests on science and math between boys and girls in fourth grade have merely no difference, girls continue to lose their interest in STEM-related subjects and activities.</p>

            <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <h3>How can we keep them interested in the field?</h3>
            <p class="last">The solution is to design a platform and wearable device to facilitate girls, educators, and caregivers to form a STEM community where they can access resources and motivate each other to stay in the STEM field.</p>

          </section>


         <article class="intro">
           <h3>Research Methods</h3>
           <p>I started this project with affinity diagram, ethnographic research, observational study, user survey, competitive analysis, and user persona to understand the target users in-depth and analyze the existing
             market so that I could offer the most suitable solution to their problems.</p>
           <!--<p class = "note">* The survey questions were completed by over 30 people. Demographics of the responders included parents who have children, young professionals between 18-34, students, and full-time employees with a different background.</p>-->
        </article>

        <article class="content tasks">
           <h4>Affinity Diagram</h4>
           <p>I started the project by brainstorming my awareness of STEM including existent STEM products, programs, media outlets, advertisements of STEM, STEM education, and cost of STEM activities and programs. Then I created an affinity diagram by organizing my attributes.
             This process helped me to start thinking more deeply about the subject.</p>


           <h4>Ethonographic Research</h4>
           <p>The purpose of the ethnographic research was to analyze how girls aged between
             9 to 13 years old interact with STEM subjects. I felt that it was essential for me to observe the relationships with each other while learning, the existing STEM programs, the environment, and the interaction with activities and products in order for me to design a product that could help girls interested in STEM subjects.</p>

           <h4>Observational Study</h4>
           <p>I started the research by visiting a workshop that was hosted by Apple in Palo Alto to introduce young generations to the technology. I conducted an observational study at the Ardenwood School in Fremont, CA while the “Girls Who Code” meeting was taking place. Additionally, I have visited several science museums such as
             the Lawrence Hall of Science and Chabot Space & Science Center to observe existent STEM activities, programs, and products and how girls interacted with them.</p>

           <h4>Challenges I encountered</h4>
           <p><strong>What worked the best </strong> for me was to understand the users by talking to experts in the filed and observe STEM classroom where girls interact with. Because of the extensive research, I was able to identify the problem and offer the best solution for target users. </p>
           <p><strong>What did not work</strong> for me  was creating a vague wireframe. I should have spent more time putting details in wireframe so that it requires less revisions on high fidelity mockup. For next project, I am going to spend more time focused on adding details.</p>
           <p class="last"><strong>What I have learned</strong> in this project was the importance of the iterative design process. For instance, the initial homepage was overwhelming and did not provide clear navigation. After the series of usability testing, I redesigned it with a clear visual hierarchy with plenty of white space to navigate the page without overwhelming the users. </p>
