           <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
           <p>Behub is a family-friendly app that helps to manage and organize a family’s schedule and content by collaborating among family members. The client was interested in going into the cloud storage and organizational market. We helped to identify the
             right target market and designed and prototyped a mobile app solution by implementing clean and fun visual elements, folders to collect and save content, message feature, and a gentle reminder. </p>

            <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
            <h3>Why are parents frustrated?</h3>
            <p>The busy parents with kids have an exhausting time managing a family’s schedule and supporting each other in the most efficient way. While they communicate via email, text, or phone call, the changes they discuss are often forgotten among other things.</p>


            <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p class="last">We offer a family-friendly collaboration app that is easy and visually appealing to use even for the youngest family member.
              It provides a clean and easy-to-browse calendar, folders to collect and save interesting content, a message feature to communicate and collaborate instantly, and a gentle reminder to update the schedule at the preferred time: one app to bring families and friends closer.</p>

           <h3>Client's Scope</h3>
           <p>The client was interested in going into the cloud storage and organization market. They had some features in mind including saving content users find on the web, organizing that content, and uploading files. The important aspect of this product was collaboration. They believed that collaboration and social sharing features were what users would like to have. Since my client did not have a clear vision for the project or the target market, I began by user survey to test their assumptions about the user’s wants and needs.</p>
           <p class = "note">* The survey questions were completed by over 30 people. Demographics of the responders included parents who have children, young professionals between 18-34, students, and full-time employees with different backgrounds.</p>

           <p>•  When you use collaboration features, who do you often collaborate with?  </p>
           <p>•  What kind of contents do you share and work collaboratively? </p>
           <p>•  What kind of contents do you think you want to share and work collaboratively if you do use collaborative features? (for those who are not current users of collaboration features)</p>

           <h3>Branding</h3>
           <p>First, I conducted branding research, brainstorming, and mind mapping. Then I created a mood board to establish the feel and direction for this project. Since I wanted this product to be clean, calm, soothing, positive, and cheerful, I collected images, words, textures that echo those values.
             With the branding concept, I sketched various logos and created the final logo as well as a branding and design style guide. </p>
           <h4>Why behub?</h4>
           <p>I chose to utilize the symbol of the bee which reflects the <strong>community</strong>, <strong>brightness</strong>, and <strong>personal power</strong>.
                 The name originates from “being” yourself + the community, place where users can come and collaborate together. </p>

          <h4>Improvements we achieved</h4>
          <p>The Behub offered families and groups of close friends the more secure way to collaborate and share information including photos, “to-do”  lists, etc. The built-in integrated calendars allowed seamless and
            secure updates within shared groups and improved user communications.</p>
            <br></br>
          <h5>Business impact:</h5>
          <p>The iterative prototyping and user research resulted in the fast development of the final product that increased the collaboration among family members by <strong> 30% </strong>compared to the earlier surveys.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h5>User impact:</h5>
          <p>The interviewed users expressed more desire to use cloud platforms to manage their calendars and photos within a secure group of people that Behub has offered. <strong>75% </strong>of the surveyed family users were
            satisfied with the use of shared calendar features and to-do lists.</p>

          <h4>Challenges I encountered</h4>
          <p><strong>What worked the best </strong>for me for this project was to find the right target market by conducting user research, competitive analysis, and user persona.</p>
          <p class="last"><strong> The challenge I ran into </strong> while working on this project was the user flow of the message feature. Initially, the message feature was placed in the calendar feature. I believed that users would like to contact the collaborators when they would like to update the schedule to arrange their schedules. However, the usability testing proved that users had a difficult time finding the message feature, therefore I decided to move it to the collaborator’s page where many users were intuitively going to find it. I learned that it was crucial to get feedback from users as often as possible. It is so easy to miss something obvious when I am working on the same project for a long period of time.</p>
